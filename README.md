Seed
---

It's seed for my workflow make me to quickly and easily create a front-end project. This mean that the seed will be changed and updated if I found out some better things or more suitable tools.

Note that the seed differ from yo of generator. It's exclusive of project source and code struction that focus on auto-building and compile for any type of project.
